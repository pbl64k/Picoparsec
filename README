A simple parser library, relatively expressive, but neither space- nor time-
efficient.

Now available both in PHP and in JavaScript.

Namespaced version of Picoparsec/PHP due to https://github.com/kykc

A sketch of linear fare parser (Apollo format) is included. We're using a
finite state machine in production for this, which is robust and efficient,
but not quite as readable.
